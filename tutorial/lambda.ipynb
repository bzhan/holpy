In this section, we discuss construction of *lambda terms*, which completes the representation of terms in *lambda calculus*.\n",

    "The motivation is as follows: we have already noted that terms can have function type. For example, in the previous section, we can declare a variable $f$ of type $nat \\To nat$ by `Var(\"f\", TFun(NatType, NatType))`. We have also encountered constants that have function type, for example the addition operator. However, we have not said anything about how to construct new examples of such functions.\n",

For example, there should be a function that takes as input a natural number $n$, and outputs $n+2$. In higher-order logic (also known as *simply-typed lambda calculus*), we can represent such functions as *lambda terms*. The above function can be written (in mathematical notation) as:\n",

It is important to note that *the name of the bound variable does not matter*. The expression $\\lambda n. n + 2$ means the same thing as the expression $\\lambda m. m + 2$. Both represent functions that add 2 to its input. We say that two terms are *$\\alpha$-equivalent* if one can be changed to the other by changing the names of some bound variables."
