    "In this section, we introduce the central concept of macros. Macros are deduction rules that serve as abbreviations for more elementary proof steps. In both linear proof and proof terms, one can use an invocation of a macro to substitute for multiple steps of proof. The macro invocations can be expanded on demand during proof checking. Hence, they shorten the length of proofs that need to be stored, and make the whole system scalable to large proofs.\n",

    "The standard way to create a macro is to inherit from class `ProofTermMacro` (so called because it constructs a macro from functions working with proof terms). The new macro class needs to implement the `get_proof_term` method, which takes as arguments the current theory, arguments to the macro, and a list of input proof terms. If the inputs are valid, the function should return the resulting proof term.\n",
