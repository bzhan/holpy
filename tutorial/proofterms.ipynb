    "In the previous two sections, we showed how to prove theorems about equality and propositional logic. Let us review what we have done so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each statement to be proved, we first wrote down the proof step-by-step in a semi-formal language, where each step consists of applying a primitive deduction rule, or some composite rule (such as apply_theorem). This proof is then checked by converting the semi-formal proof into Python code. In the Python code, we are careful to construct theorems using only a limited set of functions: `thy.get_theorem` or one of the primitive deduction rules (`Thm.assume`, `Thm.implies_intr`, etc). For the composite rule, we defined corresponding Python functions, which again construct theorems using only the limited set of functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this way, as long as we keep to calling only the limited set of functions, either directly or indirectly through custom procedures, and if the limited set of functions correctly implement the primitive deduction rules of higher-order logic, we can trust that our proof is correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "While this already substantially increases our confidence in the proofs, we can still do better. First, it is difficult to ensure that the theorem objects are constructed using only the limited set of functions. This gets more difficult as the size of the code increases, and when multiple teams are collaborating on a project. Second, we cannot completely trust our implementation of the primitive deduction rules. Ideally, we should allow programs written by others to check our proof. Both of these problems can be solved by storing a trace of the proof, so it can be checked later, either using the same program or using other programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two kinds of traces that we will consider, which we call linear proof and proof term.\n",
    "\n",
    "A linear proof (class `Proof`) is a list of proof items (class `ProofItem`). Each proof item contains an identifier, deduction rule used, arguments to the deduction rule, and input sequents (referred to by the identifiers of corresponding proof items).\n",

    "While linear proofs are intuitive and can be printed in an easily readable form, they are difficult to generate automatically. When generating proofs, we prefer a pattern where each proved result is considered an object, and new results are produced by combining existing proved results in any order. In this way, the produced proof resembles a tree: at the root is the final result of the proof. At each node is an intermediate statement, and the edges characterize dependency between intermediate statements. Such trees correspond to `ProofTerm` objects in Python.\n",

    "In this section, we studied how to construct both linear proofs and proof terms. These allow us to produce traces of proofs that can be checked independently, including by third-party tools. There is, however, one major problem remaining with this approach: all proofs constructed so far consists only of primitive deduction rules. As we move to more complicated examples, these proofs can get very long, especially as we rely more and more on automatic procedures for producing proofs. It would be nice if it is possible to condense proofs produced by automatic procedures, for example reducing the multiple steps of proof produced by an invocation of `apply_theorem` to just one step. This leads to the important concept of *macros*, which we will begin to study in the next section."
