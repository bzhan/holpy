step: t9 bind
reason: step t9 uses t9.t1 but doesn't include it in premises
2.
file_name: QF_UFLIA\\wisas\\xs_5_5.smt2
step: t213 resolution
reason: resolving one proof term for twice
3.
file_name: QF_UFLIA\\wisas\\xs_5_10.smt2
step: t27 sum_simplify
reason:  rhs side has zero on the right
4.
filename: files in QF_UFLRA\\cpachecker-induction-svcomp14
problem: output empty proof
5.
file_name: QF_UFLRA\\mathsat\\RandomCoupled\\pb_real_10_0200_10_14.smt2
step: minus_simplify
problem: -12 == -12 should be proved by uminus_simplify rule rather than minus_simplify rule
6.
file_name: QF_UFLRA\\mathsat\\RandomDecoupled\\pb_real_30_60_45_06.smt2
step: minus_simplify
problem: -17 * x5 - 16 * x17 ==  -17 * x5 - 16 * x17 - 0
7.
file_name: UFLIA\\misc\\list5.smt2
step: t140 (resolution)
problem: extra double negation in the result.
8.
file_name: UFLIA/sledgehammer/TwoSquares/smtlib.832972.smt2
step t183 (ite_intro)
problem: expected rhs has fewer conjuncts.
step t201 (ite_intro)
problem: expected rhs has no extra conjuncts.
9.
file_name: UFLIA/sledgehammer/Fundamental_Theorem_Algebra/smtlib.1438328.smt2
step t292 (th_resolution)
problem: repeated clauses hindering resolution getting correct result.
10.
file_name: UF/sledgehammer/Arrow_Order/smtlib.617784.smt2
step 31 (bind)
problem: suspected variable name conflict
