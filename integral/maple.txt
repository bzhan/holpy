MIT2013: Exercise 13(slagle can solve), Exercise 23(slagle can solve)

MIT2014: Exercise 7(Although can get the result, but it is unsimplified)

MIT2019: Exercise 1(slagle can't solve)

MIT2020: Exercise 7

Trig: Exercise 6, Exercise 7(success, but cos(pi/2) cannot be simplified in the result), Exercise 12, 
      Exercise 13, Exerise 17, Exercise 25
      Exercise 11, Exercise 18, Exercise 27

ByParts: Exercise 14(result is unsimplified), Exercise 21, 22, 23(slagle cannot solve but maple could)

LogAndTangent: 

PartialFraction: Exercise 12, 17, 19, 



Conclusion: Maple sometimes cannot simplify the constant trigonometric function in the result as well as not does 
well in integration involving trigonometric functions, but Maple treat fractions and integration by parts and Partial Fraction better.
