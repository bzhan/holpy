In both linear proof and proof terms, one can use an invocation of a macro to substitute for multiple steps of proof. The macro invocations can be expanded on demand during proof checking. Hence, they shorten the length of proofs that need to be stored, and make the whole system scalable to large proofs.\n",

In this way, we do not have to trust that the implementations of macros are correct: if there is any bug in the implementation, an exception will be raised when generating the full proof, or the generated proof will be incorrect and cannot pass proof-checking. Hence, always expanding macros give a very high level of confidence in the proofs. However, this level of confidence has a cost: often the sequent obtained by the macro can be computed much more efficiently than generating the full proof. Hence, it is often helpful to directly evaluate the sequent obtained by the macro, without generating full proofs. This lowers the level of confidence we have in the proof (if there is any bug in the evaluation function, it can go undetected and result in an incorrect proof), but the increase in efficiency can be substantial.\n",
